# 'Tic-Tac-Toe' by Maria Valentina Gottardello

## Introduction:

This Tic-Tac-Toe consists on a very simple game!

The goal of the game is to achieve a line of three elements (X or O in my version of the game) before the other contestant.

There're probably many features of the game that I could have improved, however I am very happy with the result and I hope you enjoy it as well!

Some of the features my game version includes are:
